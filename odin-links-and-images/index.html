    <h1> Homepage </h1>
    <h2> Links </h2>
    <p> When creating links we have two options: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Absolute Links </li>
        <li> Relative Links </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Absolute Links </h3>
    <p> An <em> Absolute Link </em> is a link to a page on another website. </p>
    <p> Here is an <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about"> Example </a> </p>

    <h3> Relative Links </h3>
    <p> A <em> Relative Link </em> links to pages on the same website. </p>
    <p> They do not include the domain (Eg Http://www.websitename.com).</p>
    <p> Relative links only include the file name <em> relative </em> to the current page </p>
    <p> For example, if we have a page (about.html) in the same directory, we can link to it by using just 'about.html' in the href, <a href="./pages/about.html"> Like this </a> </p>
    <p> When looking for files in directories it is recommended to include `./` before the link.</p>
    <p> If you would like to look in a parent directory you can use `../` </p>
    
    <h2> Images </h2>
    <p> You can display images using the "<img>" tag </p>
    <p> <em> Note: img tags are self closing, meaning they do not need a closing "</img>" tag </em> </p>
    <p> To embed an image, use the 'src' attribute in the tag, and specify the location </p>
    <p> Just like this: </p>
    <img src="./images/cool-dog.jpg" alt="A cool dog is a grey cardigan"/>

    <h3> Alt attribute </h3>
    <p> it is always always important to add an alt attribute to any image. </p>
    <p> This will be used in place of the image and is important for accessibility for any visually impaired people </p>
